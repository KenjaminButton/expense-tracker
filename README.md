# Expense Tracker

Before we get started, let's spend some time using the app in its current implementation to ensure we understand how it’s supposed to work.
Note: I suggest to rebuild our App's file structure for a more comprehensive understanding (as shown in the first commit).

### Create a Budgets Slice

At the top of budgetsSlice.js:

1a. Import createSlice from @reduxjs/toolkit.
[Redux Toolkit Documentation](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createslice)
```javascript
import createSlice from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
```
Define a slice by calling createSlice() with a configuration object containing the required name, initialState, and reducers properties. [Redux Toolkit Documentation](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createslice)

2a. Define a variable, budgetsSlice, and initialize it with a call to createSlice(), passing in an empty configuration object. Do this right after the line defining initialState.
```javascript
const budgetsSlice = createSlice({

});
```
2b. Slices are conventionally named for the resource whose state they manage. This slice manages budgets and should be named accordingly. To give the slice a name, add a name property to the configuration object and set it equal to 'budgets'.
```javascript
const budgetsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'budgets',
});
```
2c. Add an initialState property to the configuration object, and set it equal to the variable initialState that we’ve defined for you.
```javascript
const budgetsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'budgets',
  initialState: initialState,
});
```
2d. Lastly, you’ll need to include a reducers property in the configurations object. For now, set it equal to an empty object.
```javascript
const budgetsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'budgets',
  initialState: initialState,
  reducers: {

  },
});
```

3a. Add an editBudget property to the reducers object passed to createSlice().
```javascript
const budgetsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'budgets',
  initialState: initialState,
  reducers: {

  },
});
```
3b. Set editBudget equal to a case reducer that receives two arguments—state and action . action.payload will have a category and amount property.
```javascript
const budgetsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'budgets',
  initialState: initialState,
  reducers: {
    // Set editBudget equal to a case reducer that receives two arguments—state and action
    editBudget: (state, action) => {
      // action.payload will have a category and amount property.
      const {category, amount} = action.payload;
    }
  },
});
```
3c. editBudget should update the state by finding the budget object whose .category value matches action.payload.category and changing with the .amount value to action.payload.amount.
```javascript
const budgetsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'budgets',
  initialState: initialState,
  reducers: {
    // Set editBudget equal to a case reducer that receives two arguments—state and action
    editBudget: (state, action) => {
      // action.payload will have a category and amount property.
      // const {category, amount} = action.payload;
      const category = action.payload.category;
      const amount = action.payload.amount;
      // Update the state by finding the budget object
      // Note: the variables category and action, implemented below, are each assigned action.payload (referenced in the above const). 
      // Ex. category = action.payload.category ;
      // Ex. amount = action.payload.category;
      // The budget object whose .category value matches action.payload.category and changing with the .amount value to action.payload.amount.
      state.find(budget => budget.category === category).amount = amount 
    }
  },
});
```

Delete your old code and clean up your exports.

4a. Delete the stand-alone editBudget. At the bottom of the file budgetsSlice.js, export the editBudget action creator generated by createSlice() and stored in budgetsSlice.
```javascript
// export const { myActionCreator } = mySlice.actions;
export const { editBudget } = budgetsSlice.actions;
```

4b. Delete the stand-alone budgetsReducer, and update the export default statement to export the reducer generated by createSlice() and stored in budgetsSlice.
```javascript
// export default mySlice.reducer;
export default budgetsSlice.reducer;
```

##### Checkpoint 1: We are now able to edit budgets and see out changes reflected in the app.

In transactionsSlice.js:

5a. Import createSlice from @reduxjs/toolkit.
```javascript
import createSlice from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
```

Define a slice by calling createSlice() with a configuration object containing the required name, initialState, and reducers properties.

6a. Define a variable, transactionsSlice, and initialize it with a call to createSlice(), passing in an empty configuration object.
```javascript
const transactionsSlice = createSlice({});
```
6b. Add a name property to the configuration object and set it equal to 'transactions'.
```javascript
const transactionsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'transactions',
});
```
6c. Add an initialState property to the configuration object, and set it equal to the variable initialState that we’ve defined for you.
```javascript
const transactionsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'transactions',
  initialState: initialState,
});
```
6d. Lastly, you’ll need to include a reducers property in the configurations object. For now, set it equal to an empty object.
```javascript
const transactionsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'transactions',
  initialState: initialState,
  reducers: {},
});
```

Replace these stand-alone action creators and the reducer with case reducers defined in the object passed to createSlice().

7a. Add an addTransaction property to the reducers object passed to createSlice().
```javascript
const transactionsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'transactions',
  initialState: initialState,
  reducers: {
    addTransaction: () => {},

  },
});
```
7b. Set addTransaction equal to a case reducer that receives two arguments—state and action. It should add the new transaction object (action.payload) to the correct category’s transaction list in the transactions state object.
```javascript
const transactionsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'transactions',
  initialState: initialState,
  reducers: {
    addTransaction: (state, action) => {
      // add the new transaction object (action.payload) to the correct category’s transaction list in the transactions state object.
      const category = action.payload.category;
      state[category].push(action.payload);
    },

  },
});
```
7c. Add a deleteTransaction property to the reducers object passed to createSlice().
```javascript
const transactionsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'transactions',
  initialState: initialState,
  reducers: {
    addTransaction: (state, action) => {
      // add the new transaction object (action.payload) to the correct category’s transaction list in the transactions state object.
      const category = action.payload.category;
      state[category].push(action.payload);
    },
    // Add a deleteTransaction property 
    deleteTransaction: () => {
      
    }
  },
});
```
7d. Set deleteTransaction equal to a case reducer that receives two arguments—state and action. It should delete the old transaction (action.payload) from the correct category’s transaction list in the transactions state object.
```javascript
const transactionsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'transactions',
  initialState: initialState,
  reducers: {
    addTransaction: (state, action) => {
      // add the new transaction object (action.payload) to the correct category’s transaction list in the transactions state object.
      const category = action.payload.category;
      state[category].push(action.payload);
    },
    // Add a deleteTransaction property 
    deleteTransaction: (state, action) => {
      // In the deletedIndex in transactionsReducer, action.payload.category and action.payload.id are both used. 
      const id = action.payload.id;
      const category = action.payload.category;
      // It should delete the old transaction (action.payload) from the correct category’s transaction list in the transactions state object.
      // 1. Find the category in `state` that matches the `category` property on `action.payload`
      // 2.  Filter out the old transaction (the transaction with an `id` matching the `id` property on `action.payload`) from that category's transaction array.
      state[category] = state[category].filter(transaction => transaction.id !== id)

    }
  },
});
```

Delete your old code and clean up your exports.

8a. Delete the stand-alone addTransaction and deleteTransaction,  

8b. Export the addTransaction and deleteTransaction action creators generated by createSlice()and stored in transactionsSlice.
```javascript
export { addTransaction, deleteTransaction } from transactionsSlice.action;
```

8c. Delete the stand-alone transactionsReducer, 

8d. Update the export default statement to export the reducer generated by createSlice() and stored in transactionsSlice.
```javascript
export default transactionsSlice.reducer;
```
